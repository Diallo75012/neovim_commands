# Neovim Basic Commands
I started using `Neovim` and will give it a go sometimes
but use `nano` and just `normal text editor` as I get around the headacke. I have made a video about it
already. and will try to improve throughout the time using only what I need.
I use KickStart Github repo for my initial configs and will not touch configs yet, i need to have good navigation skills first 
before going mad on `lua` and `configs`
